Name: Mike Harris
How long it took: 6 hours
What I liked: I learned how to create animations, which was a new concept for me.
What I didn't like: It was frustrating that I had to update the trigger script in order to make the build work. It sounds like there were many more that also faced this issue. Overall, I learned alot from this project and found it beneficial!
